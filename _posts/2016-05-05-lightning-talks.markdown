I submitted proposals to conferences for almost two years before getting accepted. When it finally happened, I found myself in front of a 250 head audience, realising *I didn't actually know how to do proper presentations*. I wish I knew then that there are better ways. 

**Lightning talks at meetups are ideal to practice public speaking**, and experiment with explaining or pitching something in a short time. I'm trying to write one each month for the Software Craftsmanship Belgium meetups. It's only 30 attendees, so it's an opportunity to **try things that I wouldn't do as a proper conference talk yet**. And I can recycle the ones that do work for other meetups or conferences.

My self-inflicted constraints:

- **10 minutes max**, or 5 minutes + Q&A.
- Write the slides in a **single evening**.
- Take a topic that I haven't talked or written about before. Trying to explaining a topic you don't know well, is a great way to learn.
- **Assume the audience doesn't know the topic** either, so it needs to cover the basics.
- When showing code, it needs to be **understandable for people unfamiliar with the language**, and within the 30 seconds or so that the code is on the screen. I might write unidiomatic Haskell, or leave out anything complicated, or just show pseudo-code. 

Not constrained by:

- **Being original**. It doesn't have to be my own inventions, my own examples, etc. Presenting a blog post written by somebody else is perfectly fine.
- **Being precise, perfect, or nuanced**. First get it out there, then perhaps iterate later. 

I'll post the slides here. They're probably useless without the explanation, but perhaps someone finds them useful.
