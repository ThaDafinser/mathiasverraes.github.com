The slides for my talk at Build Stuff in Vilnius. (As often, the slides are not very interesting without the text.)

## Abstract

“How do you approach software modelling problems?”
When a client asked me about my mental process, I didn’t have a proper answer — yet. The question intrigued me. Do you need a propensity for modelling, or is it a learnable skill? I embarked on a mission to find modelling heuristics: the mental tools, that help us look at the problem from different angles; the little tricks to validate a model before we build it; the rules of thumb that lead us to iteratively refine our solutions. In this talk, I share some of the ideas I collected from books, from people I interviewed, and from my own experiences.
