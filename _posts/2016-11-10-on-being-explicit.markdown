## Abstract

“Make the implicit explicit” must be one of the most valuable advices I ever got about software modelling and design. Gather around for some tales from the trenches: stories from software projects where identifying a missing concept, and bringing it front and centre, turned the model inside out. Our tools: metaphors, pedantry, type systems, the age old heuristic of “Follow the money”, visual models, and a healthy obsession with language.
