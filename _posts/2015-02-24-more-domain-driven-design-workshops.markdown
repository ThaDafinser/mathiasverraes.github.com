Laracon EU just announced a one day workshop on Domain-Driven Design in PHP: 

- [Amsterdam, Netherlands, August 24, 2015](http://laracon.eu/2015/)

I'll give an introduction to basic Domain-Driven Design theory, and compliment it with a practical approach. Youâ€™ll learn how to discover and evolve your domain model, and how design patterns can help you translate it to code.

Coming up this year are also these three-day workshops on Domain-Driven Design and Event Storming (language agnostic): 

- [London, UK, April 22-24, 2015](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/experiencing-domain-driven-design-workshop-with-mathias-verraes-tickets-15531735840)
- [Amsterdam (Breukelen), Netherlands, June 29 - July 1, 2015](https://www.zilverline.com/training/experiencing-domain-driven-design-2015-06-29)
- [Ghent, Belgium, August 12-14, 2015](/workshops/)
