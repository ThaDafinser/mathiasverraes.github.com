Slides for my NCrafts talk on software metaphors. As always not very useful without the explanation, but I'll link to the video as soon as it's published. In the meantime, [Yannick Grenzinger](https://twitter.com/ygrenzinger) published a short but accurate [overview of the talk](https://medium.com/@communitycarbonit/il-%C3%A9tait-une-fois-%C3%A0-ncrafts-3eme-%C3%A9pisode-be0d903431c1#.mfbapa5df) (in French).

## Abstract

When we model, we tend to do it for ourselves: gain understanding, capture the business language, and turn it into running code. But are we missing opportunities to do something more with our models? What if, instead of mirroring the business, our models could transform it? Let's find out how a healthy obsession with language and metaphor can step up from "domain-driven" to "driving the domain".
