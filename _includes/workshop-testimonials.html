        <h4>Testimonials</h4>
        <p>“Mathias taught 2 x 3 days "Experiencing Domain-Driven Design" workshops for 30 backend JEE developers, software architects and IT solution consultants at Delta Lloyd. All participants were extremely satisfied about Mathias' knowledge and insights, illustrated with experiences from real life projects, and about how he transferred this to the participants, both with theory and exercises. Also very positive is how the practical insights could be applied directly to our own software development problems in different domains of Delta Lloyd insurances." (translated from Dutch)</p>

        <p>“I spent three days immersed in the Domain-Driven Design world with Mathias. It was a great experience where I learned a lot about DDD. Mathias created an environment where we could interact all together experimenting with DDD. Furthermore Mathias adapted the workshop content dynamically to our needs and our concerns. It is a recommended experience!”</p>

        <p>“Mathias made Domain-Driven Design very real and practical. He managed to find a good balance between practical workshop, theory, and sharing experiences. This workshop really gave me the keys to use DDD in our projects and showed me new perspectives like Event Sourcing. It is definitely a must have complement to the usual books by Eric Evans and Vaughn Vernon. I would definitely recommend this workshop to any developer or architect who is keen to learn a different way to model software.”</p>

        <p>“Event Storming is truly valuable, also as an exercise. I found the patterns to separate domains and their relations very interesting. (...) I've discovered that DDD has many patterns and strategies that we seem to have lost. It is essential knowledge for every developer, from junior to architect. For more experienced developers (and business architects), the Strategic Domain-Driven Design workshop gives theory and experience to better deal with (business) domains, relations, Bounded Contexts, and how to map systems. Must attend!”<small>(translated from Dutch)</small></p>
